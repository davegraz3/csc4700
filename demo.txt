What is your favorite movie? The Sandlot

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be? Bora Bora

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)? 
Invisibility. Free flights (do invisible people need luggage?), best seats to games, free vacations (are drinks invisible too?), and sometimes you just want
to chill without anyone noticing you.
